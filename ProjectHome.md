Popolo is a collection of classes for calculating various heat transfer phenomena. The routines have been written from scratch in C#, and present a modern Applications Programming Interface (API) for .NET Framework programmers, allowing wrappers to be written for very high level languages. It contains classes to calculate solid conduction, convective heat transfer near wall surfaces, air ventilation, radiative heat balance of wall surfaces, transmitted solar radiation through a window, and so on. Users should build up these classes to simulate a whole complex building system. A sample source code to build test cases of BESTEST are provided. Since all the source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License, they can be freely downloaded from the Web site.
